__✏️ Purpose__

I created a money calculator app because counting and inputting quantities into a calculator at work was time-consuming. By developing an app, I believed we could reduce errors and improve operational efficiency.


__🤖　Functions__

・　When you input the number of bills or coins for each denomination, the total amount for each denomination will be automatically displayed.

・　When you press the calculate button, the total amount will be displayed.

・　When you press the clear button, all input values will be deleted, and the total amount will be reset to zero.
